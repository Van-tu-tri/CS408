Sabanci University Course: Computer Networks

A serverâ€“client application developed using Python and Tkinter that enables uploading text files to a server and 
subsequently downloading the specified file.  
--
Note: There is still some problems with the code (When multiple people at the same time download a file
and one of them is the owner, the downloaded text comes with error to the owner). Since this project build
with very little time and heavy load, these problems will be addressed later.
